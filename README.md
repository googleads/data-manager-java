# Data Manager API utility library and samples for Java

Utility library and code samples for working with the
[Data Manager API](https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api) and Java.

## Setup instructions

https://developers.google.com/data-manager/api/get-started/set-up-access#java

## Repository structure

- [`data-manager-util`](data-manager-util): Source code for the utility library.

  Follow the setup instructions to declare a dependency on the current version
  of `com.google.api-ads:data-manager-util` in your project. Use the utilities
  in the library to help with common tasks like formatting, hashing, encrypting,
  and encoding data for Data Manager API requests.

- [`data-manager-samples`](data-manager-samples): Code samples for working with
  the Data Manager API and the utility library.

  The `data-manager-samples` project demonstrates how to set up a project that
  depends on the Data Manager API client library and the `data-manager-util`
  library. Check out the
  [samples](data-manager-samples/src/main/java/com/google/ads/datamanager/samples/)
  directory for code samples that construct and send requests to the Data Manager
  API.
